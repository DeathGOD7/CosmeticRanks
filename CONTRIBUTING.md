### Hello there, want to contribute?
In order for everyone to have the best experience possible, we have a few guidelines that everyone must follow.
- We strictly follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),which means whenever a non-backwards compatible change is made, the major version will increment. When there are new features, the minor version will increase, and as such, small bug fixes and patches will increase the patch version. (Major.Minor.Patch / x.y.z)
- For all things on GitHub, please make sure you follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/DeathGOD7/CosmeticRanks/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- When creating an issue, please make sure you're using the issue templates.
- When submitting a pull request, please make sure you're using the [pull request template](https://github.com/DeathGOD7/CosmeticRanks/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- Lastly, be sure to follow the project code writing style. (Tabs and Indents,Curly brackets,etc)
